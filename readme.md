# Debugging
The art of fiding, analyzing and correcting errors in code.

- `Syntax` errors - These are often detected by the compiler.
- `Logic` errors - Refer to code that is syntatically correct but does not behave as expected, these are hard to detect and can be found with a `debugger` tool.

# Debugger
A tool that allows code execution to pause at a breakpoint.

Once code is paused, we can analyize the current state of `variables`, `objects` etc...
